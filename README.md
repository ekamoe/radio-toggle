# radio-toggle

Map prototype with radio buttons to toggle between three custom styles. Map starts with the zoom-switch-lightweight prototype and can be toggled to view only one layer: mean_grid_cell_ct or mean_ssp. This version uses three map loads each time and does not have zoom constraints.

testing again, please.
